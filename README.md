# DAPNET2JS


Test implementation of an transmitter controlled via nodejs

Used for myself to understand how the dapnet protocol is working.

Thanks to Simon DL1NE for his PyPager which helped me to understand the timeslot, G4KLX for his DAPNETGateway, the guys who made tcpdump.
And Github Copilot for avoiding me to make stupid errors.

Credits to DL1NE for the timeslot part of my system.


This is a test repo to understand how to implement the dapnet protocol
There might be a problem with my timeslot management, but it is made for everyone to understand.
